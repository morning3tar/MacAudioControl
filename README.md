## **üì¢ Overview**
This is an **experimental** project that allows users to **remotely control their Mac‚Äôs audio** (volume, mute/unmute) using an **iOS app** via MQTT messaging.

- üì° **Uses MQTT** for real-time communication between Mac & iPhone
- üîä **macOS Menu Bar App** for controlling volume, mute, and showing connected audio devices
- üì± **iOS App** for adjusting Mac volume remotely
- üåê **Auto-Discovery with Bonjour** to connect without manually entering the Mac's IP
- ‚ö° **Launch at Login support** for automatic startup on macOS

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is an **initial project** with known bugs and missing features. If I have time, I will fix them later. Contributions are welcome!

## **üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup**
### **1‚É£ Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker**
This project uses **Mosquitto** as the MQTT broker. Install it via Homebrew:

```
Start the Mosquitto service:
```bash
brew services start mosquitto
```

### **2‚É£ Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/morning3tar/MacAudioControl.git
cd MacAudioControl
```

### **3‚É£ Xcode**
- **For macOS app:** Open `MacAudioControl/`
- **For iOS app:** Open `iOSAudioControl/`

### **4‚É£ Run the Apps**
- **macOS:** Run the `MacAudioControl` app, which will start MQTT & register Bonjour.
- **iOS:** Run the `iOSAudioControl` app, and it should auto-discover the Macbook.

## **üêõ Known Issues & TODOs**
- **Auto-Discovery might fail** ‚Üí Requires manual IP entry if Bonjour is not working
- **No authentication yet** ‚Üí Any iPhone on the network with the app can control the Mac (future fix: add authentication)
- **Volume updates might not be instant** ‚Üí Needs better state management
- **Mosquitto needs to be manually installed** ‚Üí Will automate in future updates

> If you experience issues, restart both apps and Mosquitto:
> ```bash
> brew services restart mosquitto
> ```

---

## **Future Improvements**
- **More polished UI** for the iOS app with an interactive volume knob
- **Better security** to prevent unauthorized volume control
- **iOS Widget** to quickly adjust Mac‚Äôs volume
- **Mac App Notarization** for easier installation
